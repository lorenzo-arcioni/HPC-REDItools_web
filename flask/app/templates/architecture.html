        <h2>Architecture design</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="description">
        <p>The rationale behind the application can be summarized as follows: the user, intending to perform RNA-editing detection, accesses Web-REDItool and inputs the HPC path of the BAM files into the <A href="http://raganella.deb.unitus.it:49153/start.html">form</A> provided. Web-REDItools then create a compressed tar file, which must be transferred to the HPC platform. The user should extract the tar file and execute the resulting bash script on the HPC platform. This initiates a distributed pipeline that analyzes the input BAM files separately and independently, leading to a significant reduction in processing time. As a result, the parallel software produces multiple TSV files, one for each split BAM file, as well as a final report file (log).



</p>
        <img src="../static/function_details.png" alt="Pipeline" width="1200">
        <p>This approach enables researchers to obtain comprehensive 
           and accurate RNA-editing detection results within significantly shorter timeframes, enhancing their ability to analyze and understand the 
            information encoded in the big data BAM files.

        <h2>Phase 1: Collecting the Input Files</h2>
        <p>As an initial step, the master process selects and counts the input files provided by the user, which contain all the necessary information for RNA-editing detection.
            Each process will then be assigned a BAM file on which to perform the analysis in the second phase.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Performing the Alignment -->
    <div class="block">
        <h2>Phase 2: Performing the Analysis</h2>
        <p>The second step involves analyzing the various  BAM files contained within the input directory. Each process initiates an instance of the REDItools software, which uses<A HREF="https://github.com/BioinfoUNIBA/REDItools/blob/master/NPscripts/REDItoolDnaRnav13.py">REDItools version 3</A>  to detect RNA-editing events. By utilizing parallel processing, multiple instances of the software are launched simultaneously, enabling faster and more efficient analysis of a large number of BAM files.</p>

<p>As the REDItools software runs, it generates detection results for each process involved in the analysis. These results, one for each BAM file, represent the individual findings and matches discovered by each instance of the software.</p>
